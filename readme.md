# Fit | Track Your Workout In Real-Time.

Fit is a workout tracker that helps users to pin their daily exercises on a map. There are two workout types: running and cycling. On the application's interface, user clicks on the map to generate coordinates of the location he/she worked out. The click on the map generates a form which entails distance, duration and cadence for running, and distance, duration and elevation gain for cycling.

The user fills the form and submits it by hitting the enter key, this action will render the infomation on a list and also pinned to the map. This workout data is then passed to a storage which stores the data, this allows the user to keep records of his workout. When the user leaves and returns to the app, he will have his previouse workout stored for me.
